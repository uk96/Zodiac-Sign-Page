				<article><div style="font-size:30;color:blue">ARIES</div><div>Mar 20 – Apr 20</div>
				<p style="font-size:17">Aries(meaning "ram") is the first astrological sign in the zodiac, spanning the first 30 degrees of celestial longitude (0°=x<30°). Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this sign mostly between March 21 and April 19 each year. This time duration is exactly the first month of Solar Hejri calendar (Farvardin). The symbol of the ram is based on the Chrysomallus, the flying ram that provided the Golden Fleece.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17">In western astrology, Aries is a sign of initiative; a leader, with bravery, and the autonomy required to commence. Uncomfortable with inaction, Aries is the Cardinal sign of Fire, and thus is the zodiac of drive. Ruled by Mars, Aries is strongly autonomous, and can be headstrong and crass, sometimes showing an impulsive or reckless approach to issues. With the Ram as their standard, Aries tends toward obstinate and self-seeking. Jaunty and self-supporting, Aries is capable of independence. This quality may encourage others to emulate—but Aries is unlikely to pause for supporters. When Aries is found in a chart, there is enthusiasm and decisiveness.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17">People under the Aries sign are believed to be like a child who is frank, enthusiastic, fierce, a bit hotheaded and loyal to their friends. Since Aries is the first astrological sign in spring during which everything comes to life, the Arians are believed to be always vigorous and passionate</p>

				<article><div style="font-size:30;color:blue">TAURUS</div><div>Apr 20 – May 21</div>
				<p style="font-size:17">Taurus (Latin for "the Bull") is the second astrological sign in the present zodiac. It spans the 30–60th degree of the zodiac. The Sun is in the sign of Taurus from about April 21 until about May 21(Western astrology) or from about May 16 to June 16(Sidereal astrology). People born between these dates, depending on which system of astrology they subscribe to, may be called Taureans.The symbol of the bull is based on the Cretan Bull, the white bull that fathered the Minotaur who was killed by Theseus.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17">Practical and well-grounded, Taurus is the sign that harvests the fruits of labor. They feel the need to always be surrounded by love and beauty, turned to the material world, hedonism, and physical pleasures. People born with their Sun in Taurus are sensual and tactile, considering touch and taste the most important of all senses. Stable and conservative, this is one of the most reliable signs of the zodiac, ready to endure and stick to their choices until they reach the point of personal satisfaction.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17"> Being the one who betrayed their best friend, goddess Hera herself, this is an unfortunate being that has to wander the Earth in order to find freedom. As if something was always poking them behind their back, reminding them of happiness that once was, stinging and pushing forwards, they close up in their own worlds, lonely and separated from their core. To find love, a Taurus has to travel the world, change perspective or make a shift in their entire belief system and their system of values.</p>

				<article><div style="font-size:30;color:blue">GEMINI</div><div>Apr 20 – May 21</div>
				<p style="font-size:17">Gemini (pronunciation:  jem-in-eye or jem-in-ee) is the third astrological sign in the zodiac, originating from the constellation of Gemini. Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this sign between May 21 and June 21. Gemini is represented by The Twins Castor and Pollux.The symbol of the twins is based on the Dioscuri, two mortals that were granted shared godhood after death.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17">Astrologers believe Geminis have a volatile temperament, that their strength however is their versatility, and that their versatility allows them to learn a little about everything and develop skills in many areas. Geminis are considered to hold mysteriously unique artistic and creative abilities unlike other signs. Often considered to be very intelligent individuals, they have a wide appreciation for the arts, philosophy, history and the natural sciences. They do not like boring people or routine procedures and therefore struggle to deal with authoritative figures. They are enlightened to talk about any subject which they find interesting and where they can stimulate their naturally intellectual personalities. Geminis are noted to be drastic and hasty yet very responsible and disciplined. They are considered to be the most misunderstood of all signs due to their dual personality expressed by the twins of their sign. Because of this, don't be surprised to often find Geminis in different moods and therefore mood swings can occur often for Geminis because of their high degree of mental processing and thinking. This makes them quite philosophical people. Geminis are sensitive as well but use their high intelligence to counter anything that upsets them.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geminis usually get along very well with Leos, Aries and Sagittariuses. They do not see eye to eye with Pisces, Cancers, Virgos and Scorpios.</p>

				<article><div style="font-size:30;color:blue">CANCER</div><div>Jun 21 – Jul 23</div>
				<p style="font-size:17">Cancer (Greek: Karkinos; Latin: Cancer) is the fourth astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Cancer. It spans the 90° to 120° of the zodiac, between 90° and 120° of celestial longitude. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this area on average between June 22 and July 22, and under the sidereal zodiac, the Sun transits this area between approximately July 16 and August 15.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17">The sign of Cancer is said to be associated with the characteristics: introspective, phlegmatic, cardinal, nocturnal, tenacious, intuitive, emotional, indolent, domestic, eloquent, refined, empathic, and clairvoyant.Geographical locations that Cancer is associated with are the sea, rivers, lakes, brooks, wells, wash-houses, marsh grounds, trenches, sinks, cellars, and other locations marked by a presence of water.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17">Cancerians are said to be people of sensation and feeling, and are considered by many astrologers to be the most sensitive sign of the zodiac. They tend to judge the world through intuition as opposed to logic. They are highly spiritual but are also characterized by emotional tension and heightened ambition. Cancer is considered one of the most enigmatic signs of the zodiac, an association largely attributed to its ruling planet being that of the Moon.</p>

				<article><div style="font-size:30;color:blue">LEO</div><div>Jul 23 – Aug 23</div>
				<p style="font-size:17">Leo (Latin: Leon), is the fifth astrological sign of the zodiac, originating from the constellation of Leo. It comes after Cancer (Latin: Karkinos) and before Virgo (Latin: Parthenos). Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this area on average between July 22 and August 23; the sign spans the 120th to 150th degree of celestial longitude.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17">People born under the sign of Leo are natural born leaders. They are dramatic, creative, self-confident, dominant and extremely difficult to resist, able to achieve anything they want to in any area of life they commit to. There is a specific strength to a Leo and their "king of the jungle" status. Leo often has many friends for they are generous and loyal. Self-confident and attractive, this is a Sun sign capable of uniting different groups of people and leading them as one towards a shared cause, and their healthy sense of humor makes collaboration with other people even easier.</p>
				<p style="font-size:17">Ruled by the Sun, Leo worships this fiery entity in the sky, quite literally as well as metaphorically. They are in search for self-awareness and in constant growth of ego. Aware of their desires and personality, they can easily ask for everything they need, but could just as easily unconsciously neglect the needs of other people in their chase for personal gain or status. When a Leo representative becomes too fond and attached to their achievements and the way other people see them, they become an easy target, ready to be taken down.
